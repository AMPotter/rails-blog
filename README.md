# README

This is just a simple lil' repo I'm using to follow along to a Ruby on Rails demo.
Git isn't necessary for the demo, but I figure it's a good idea to make sure I identify any hiccups in my workflow, since this is my first attempt at Ruby on Rails.

You can find that demo here: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

Have a splendid day.
